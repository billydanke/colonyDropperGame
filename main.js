probeResultsList = ["While the surface has yielded few results, probing deep beneath the surface has resulted in the discovery of liquid water and a mantle layer.","Sending the probe out resulted in the discovery of multiple microbial life forms frozen in the south pole of the planet.","Probe scans have resulted in the discovery of a wide range of aquatic life, some of which are potentially hazardous. While scanning the water for signs of microbial life, a large leech-like aquatic creature latched on to the probe. The probe stopped sending readings soon after.","Probing the surface has revealed multiple tribal civilizations living on the islands here. Confused and scared by the probe's space-age technology, they destroy the probe as it analyzes sand samples.","Initial probe readings indicate a vast variety of plant and animal life, along with a late atomic-age civilization that dominates the planet. Fascinated by the probe's arrival, they attempt first contact, however their language is currently unknown.","Probe readings indicate that this planet appears to have once been the home to a relatively advanced species, however, due to the many craters and radioactive materials along the surface, it appears that they have wiped themselves out by nuclear annihilation some decades in the past.","As the probe shoots across the surface, it begins to detect irregularities under the chrome layer. They appear almost like statues, rising smoothly from the ground, almost as if whatever creatures lie beneath were covered over instantly. Reaching the planet's tear, the probe's feed cuts off abruptly.","Probe scans reveal a plant species with a strange spice substance that is believed to have hallucinogenic properties, along with a species of gargantuan worm-like creatures that have adapted to survive in the planet's extreme conditions. Behavioral analysis of these creatures shows extreme hostility."];

After deploying the Colony Deployment Unit and waking the colonists, a thriving colony is established, albeit with weak bones, but made wealthy from the rich resources here.","The ship touches down gently on the south pole and extends its Colony Deployment Unit. With protective suits, the colonists begin their new future, slowly terraforming their new world and finding inoculations to the bacteria frozen solid below their feet.","The colony ship AI performs controlled firings of its atmospheric thrusters, safely bringing the ship and its colonists to a somewhat shallow region of water. Releasing the Colony Deployment Unit proved difficult, however with the help of the colonists, it is eventually fully operational. The colonists here spend their days fighting off aquatic life as they mine resources to construct their submerged cities and ships.","The ship burns hard and uses aerobraking maneuvers to eventually perform a strategic landing on the largest island in a cluster. The Colony Deployment Unit is deployed and the colonists are awoken. Due to the intense gravitational pull, constant attack by freakishly large insects, and the lack of resources, the colony eventually devolves into tribalism along with their native neighbors.","The ship performs a stable burn as it performs its landing near a native metropolis. As the Colony Deployment Unit is released, a group of native diplomats approaches the freshly awakened colonists. With the time the AI has had to analyze the species native language, it serves as an interpreter for negotiations. In the end, the colonists and the native population live in harmony with one another, blending into one people.","The ship burns to slow down against the atmosphere, landing in the middle of a large crater. With the aid of lead-lined suits, the colonists assemble the Colony Deployment Unit, spending the years to come cleaning up radiation and rediscovering this past civilization's history.","The AI experiences a series of glitches as it seemingly feels called to the planet. It begins its landing routine, slowly descending toward this mysterious metal world. Upon landing, the AI feels an unknowing urge to eject the cryo-pods onto the surface. Upon doing so, both the ship and the pods are covered instantly in the shiny metal, all now connected to the great hivemind controlling this world.","The ship lands near the base of a dune, where there seems to be an abundance of spice plants. The colonists use heat-resistant suits and rebreathers, however over time they build a tolerance to the heat and air. Some colonists are lost to the worm creatures, but they soon learn to repel their attacks. They learn to find and grow spice plants to successfully sustain a growing population, and use the plants' effects to further their space travels."];

There are no survivors.","The ship lands, but is forced to use the full force of its titanic engines. The heat begins to melt the ice below the massive landing legs of the ship. Even before the colonists are able to settle into their new habitation unit, they begin to feel sick. Within 4 days all of the colonists are dead.","A glitch in Cosmo's landing positioning system resulted in a splashdown target much deeper than what was expected. The water pressure crushes the outer hull of the vessel, leaving its frozen passengers deep within the murky darkness to rest permanently.","Upon its top speed of reentry, the primary heat shield is ripped off, causing a flameout in the ship and cryo-pods. Maybe one day the native peoples inhabiting this world will tell their children about the strange star shooting across the sky, simmering into nothing far before it ever reached the surface.","The ship performs a stable burn as it performs its landing near a native metropolis. As the Colony Deployment Unit is released, a buildup of military forces surrounds the ship. After a pause, they begin to fire on the ship. Programmed to preserve the colonist's lives, the AI uses its defense systems to vaporize the native forces. In fear of total annihilation, the natives use their nuclear arsenal against the colony ship. All colonists are lost.","The ship ignites its deceleration engines, however an error in the ship's accelerometer causes it to shut down its engines prematurely, resulting in the ship impacting the surface at a rapid speed. In the end, nothing remained of the ship but just another radioactive crater on the planet's scarred surface.","The AI experiences a series of glitches as it seemingly feels called to the planet. It begins its landing routine, aggressively firing its engines in a feverish attempt to reach the surface of this mysterious metal world. Realizing too late that the AI's decision-making was impaired, it was unable to slow down before impacting the surface. In its final effort to save the colonists, it ejects the cryo-pods, instantly being covered in the metal upon landing. No one survived.","The ship's hull and core systems are heavily damaged from the extreme heat entering the planet's atmosphere. When the ship lands, the people are immediately attacked by a worm creature. With damaged defense systems, the AI is helpless to defend the colonists. The colonists and ship are swallowed whole, doomed to die inside the belly of a space-worm."];
